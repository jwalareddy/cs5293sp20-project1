She is a fourth-generation businessperson who followed in the footsteps of her great-grandmother █████████, grandfather Fred, and father, serving for a time as an executive vice president of the family-owned █████ Organization. She was also a boardroom judge on her father's television show The Apprentice.[4][5][6]

Starting in March 2017, she left the █████ Organization and began serving in her father's presidential administration as a senior adviser alongside her husband. She assumed this official, unpaid position after ethics concerns were raised about her having access to classified material while not being held to the same restrictions as a federal employee.[7][8][9] She was considered part of the president's inner circle even before becoming an official employee in his administration.[10] She is also one of the wealthiest of her family, with an estimated net worth of $300 million.
